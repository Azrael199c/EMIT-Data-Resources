# EMIT-Data-Resources

Welcome to the EMIT-Data-Resources repository. This repository provides guides, short how-to's, and tutorials to help users access and work with data from the Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) mission. In the interest of open science this repository has been made public but is still under active development. All jupyter notebooks and scripts should be functional, however, changes or additions may be made. Contributions from all parties are welcome.

These guides, how-to's, and tutorials can also be found in the [EMIT Tutorials Repository](https://github.com/emit-sds/tutorials)

## Background  

The EMIT Project delivers space-based measurements of surface mineralogy of the Earth’s arid dust source regions. These measurements are used to initialize the compositional makeup of dust sources in Earth System Models (ESMs). The dust cycle, which describe the generation, lofting, transport, and deposition of mineral dust, plays an important role in ESMs.  Dust composition is presently the largest uncertainty factor in quantifying the magnitude of aerosol direct radiative forcing.  By understanding the composition of mineral dust sources, EMIT aims to constrain the sign and magnitude of dust-related radiative forcing at regional and global scales. During its one-year mission on the International Space Station (ISS), EMIT will make measurements over the sunlit Earth’s dust source regions that fall within ±52° latitude. EMIT will schedule up to five visits (three on average) of each arid target region and only acquisitions not dominated by cloud cover will be downlinked. EMIT-based maps of the relative abundance of source minerals will advance the understanding of current and future impacts of mineral dust in the Earth system.
