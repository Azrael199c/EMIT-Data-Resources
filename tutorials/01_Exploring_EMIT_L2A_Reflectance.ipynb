    "# 1. Exploring L2A Reflectance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary**  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will open a Level 2A (L2A) Reflectance product file (netcdf) from Earth Surface Minteral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT). We will inspect the structure and plot the spectra of individual pixels and spatial coverage of a single scene. Finally, we will take advantage of the `holoviews streams` to build an interactive plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background**\n",
    "\n",
    "The EMIT instrument is an imaging spectrometer that measures light in visible and infrared wavelengths. These measurements display unique spectral signatures that correspond to the composition on the Earth's surface. The EMIT mission focuses specifically on mapping the composition of minerals to better understand the effects of mineral dust throughout the Earth system and human populations now and in the future. More details about EMIT and its associated products can be found in the **README.md** and on the [EMIT website](https://earth.jpl.nasa.gov/emit/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The L2A Reflectance Product contains estimated surface reflectance. Surface reflectance is the fraction of incoming solar radiation reflected Earth's surface. Materials reflect proportions of radiation differently based upon their chemical composition.  This means that reflectance information can be used to determine the composition of a target. In this guide you will learn how to plot a band from the L2A reflectance spatially and look at the spectral curve associated with individual pixels.\n",

    "EMIT Data is distributed in a hierarchical NetCDF4 (.nc) format. Inside the netCDF4 file there are 3 groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The root group containing reflectance values accross the downtrack, crosstrack, and bands dimensions.  \n",
    "2. The `sensor_band_parameters`  group containing the wavelength of each band center, and the full-width half maximum (FWHM) or bandwidth at half of the maximum amplitude.  \n",
    "3. The `location` group containing latitude and longitude values of each pixel as well as a geometric lookup table (GLT). The GLT is an orthorectified image that provides relative downtrack and crosstrack reference locations from the raw scene to facilitate fast projection of the dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To access the `.nc` file we will use the `xarray` library. `xarray` only support non-hierarchical (flat) datasets, meaning that when loading a NetCDF into an `xarray.Dataset`, by default only the root group is added, the others have to be manually added. Since `xarray` does not recognize these other groups, the keys cannot be listed using that library. If we need to check what keys are present we can use the `netcdf4` library. In the case of EMIT data, the `reflectance` group is the root group, and contains reflectance values and some metadata. As mentioned above, the other groups are `sensor_band_parameters` and `location`. Assuming we don't know the groups present, lets first explore the heirarchical structure of the EMIT data using the `netcdf4` library."
